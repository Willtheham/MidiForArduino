# MidiForArduino
Do you want to build your own MIDI device for cheap? This fork should help! MidiForArduino Allows users to build a device with slide potentiometers and buttons, to create a MIDI Device, The limit of the devices is however many Analogue and Digital pins on your arduino. if you need help, Don't Fret- Just create a Issue. schematics and photos below. Some cases I reccomend if you have a 3d printer, Search on Thingiverse for a Deej case. They allow spots for faders and buttons. This code / repo is not related to Deej, But if you are intrested in build an Windows Audio Controller, Please check out the repo here: https://github.com/Miodec/deej | The schematic is very simple, as it doesn't require a-lot of work. Thank you also to: https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MIDIUSB for the Repo to use for MIDI control. Its a simple Schematic as you just need to connect the Sliders to the Arduino analog and buttons to digital. The max faders for an arduino micro is 10 and 10 buttons or however you want to configurate it. Ground is daisy chained as well as 5v, so this schematic can be very easy.  Below is the schematic, Credit to @blankets. , on discord.
